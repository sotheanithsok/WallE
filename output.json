        "Description": "We are seeking a strategic, data-driven, and entrepreneurial strategist for the Computer Science & Tech domain. This person should have extensive knowledge of the ecosystem of skills and technologies around Computer Science, Software Engineering, and a broad curiosity about technology. In particular the ideal candidate can, with minimal research, discuss curriculum strategy with industry experts on topics such as software engineering, cybersecurity, computer programming, mobile/web development, etc. This person will use internal data and market research to identify promising areas in which Coursera should create content related to Computer Science & Tech broadly, -- emphasis on software engineering. Bonus if you have a background in physical engineering. While part of the role involves identifying these key areas of strategic investment, another meaty part of the job will involve consultation to companies and universities to help their content come to life. This consultation will be done in coordination with our Partnerships Managers, and will range in scope from helping to identify specific topics in Computer Science & Tech, to reviewing proposed curricula, to creating multi-year content plans that cut across departments and content formats (e.g., Courses, Degrees). This person will also work cross-functionally with other teams that are helping to create and position content on the platform, such as our Services, Marketing, and Product teams. In short, you should have a deep knowledge of Computer Science & Tech, must be very comfortable using data to make strategic recommendations, and also be passionate about education in technical fields.",
